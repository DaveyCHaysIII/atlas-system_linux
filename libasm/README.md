Readme!

Note: for strcmp and co, the checker uses the glibc implementation (1, 0, -1) while our local implementation is using the subtract method, so if you fail the main asserts, you'll likely pass the checker, and if you fail the checker, you'll likely pass the local main checks. Since we're graded by the checker, we went with the glibc version. Do not be alarmed that these main files fail.
